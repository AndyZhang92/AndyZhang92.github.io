I am currently a quantitative researcher at [Two Sigma Investments](https://www.twosigma.com). I received my PhD in Management Science and Engineering from Stanford University (2021), advised by Professor [Jose Blanchet](https://web.stanford.edu/~jblanche/). Prior to that, I got the BE degree in Electronic Engineering and the BS degree in Mathematics from Tsinghua University (2015), and the MS degree in Operations Research from Columbia University (2016). I was a member of the [Operations Research Group](http://or.stanford.edu), and the [Advanced Financial Technologies Laboratory](https://fintech.stanford.edu/).

My research interests includes applied probability, simulation, stochastic optimization, and robust decision-making under uncertainty.
