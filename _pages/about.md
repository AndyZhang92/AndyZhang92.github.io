I am currently a PhD student of Management Science and Engineering at Stanford University, advised by Professor [Jose Blanchet](https://web.stanford.edu/~jblanche/). I received the BE degree in Electronic Engineering and the BS degree in Mathematics from Tsinghua University (2015), the MS degree in Operations Research from Columbia University (2016). I am a member of the [Operations Research Group](http://or.stanford.edu), and the
[Advanced Financial Technologies Laboratory](https://fintech.stanford.edu/people/all/grid/grouped).

I am interested in simulation, stochastic optimization, and robust decision-making under uncertainty.

I am expected to graduate in May 2021. I will join [Two Sigma Investment](https://www.twosigma.com) as a quantative researcher after my graduation.
